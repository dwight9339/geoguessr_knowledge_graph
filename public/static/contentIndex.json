Script‑by‑Script Breakdown\n4.1 Devanagari\n\nOverview: Horizontal top line (shirorekha) unites each word. Characters are vertically balanced.\nAppearances: Road signs in northern &amp; central India, newspaper mastheads, shop banners.\nGeoGuessr Tips: Look for yellow commercial-plate vehicles, left‑side driving; dense, multi‑script boards (Hindi+English).\n\n4.2 Bengali–Assamese\n\nOverview: No headstroke; characters feature open, bulbous loops. Many curves end in a tiny tail.\nAppearances: Hoardings in Kolkata, Dhaka signage, railway station boards.\nTips: Compare Bengali script (lighter loops, more open) against Assamese (subtle shape differences around ‘ঘ’/‘’).\n\n4.3 Gujarati\n\nOverview: No headline; angular strokes with small curls. Many characters end in a hook.\nAppearances: Street signs in Ahmedabad; temple plaques in diaspora communities.\nTips: Absence of top bar differentiates from Devanagari; sharper corners than Bengali.\n\n4.4 Gurmukhi\n\nOverview: Broad horizontal top stroke (like headstroke) but broken at each letter. Tall, narrow glyphs.\nAppearances: Gurdwara signage, Punjabi-language newspapers, truck art.\nTips: Uniform letter height, vertical emphasis—distinct from Devanagari’s longer headstroke.\n\n4.5 Odia\n\nOverview: Rounded characters with circular loops; minimal straight lines.\nAppearances: Odisha state road signage, temple inscriptions.\nTips: Very circular forms distinguish from Malayalam’s stacked loops.\n\n4.6 Tamil\n\nOverview: Loose curves and circles; no headline; diacritics placed around base.\nAppearances: Tamil Nadu and diaspora shop signs, temple arts.\nTips: More open shapes than Malayalam; fewer loops than Telugu.\n\n4.7 Telugu\n\nOverview: Loopy, rounded shapes; distinct wedge‑shaped terminals; sub‑components often sit below main line.\nAppearances: Andhra/Telangana road signs; film posters.\nTips: Compare with Kannada: Telugu loops are larger and more circular.\n\n4.8 Kannada\n\nOverview: Rounded like Telugu but more geometric; fewer sharp curves.\nAppearances: Karnataka state government boards, metro signage.\nTips: Smaller loops and unified baseline separate it from Telugu.\n\n4.9 Malayalam\n\nOverview: Dense network of stacked loops and diacritics; looks “squished.”\nAppearances: Kerala highway signs; Gulf‑based store banners.\nTips: Maximal loop density and vertical stacking set it apart from Tamil and Odia.\n\n\n5. Co‑occurrence &amp; Multilingual Signs\n\nNorth India metros (Delhi, Mumbai): Hindi (Devanagari) / English on metro/rail signage.\nWest Bengal: Bengali / English; occasionally Hindi (Devanagari) as tertiary.\nGujarat: Gujarati / Hindi / English trilingual boards.\nPunjab diaspora temples: Gurmukhi / English, sometimes Punjabi in Shahmukhi (Arabic script).\nKerala Gulf expat areas: Malayalam / English signage in cities like Dubai or Doha.\n\n\n6. Distinguishing Similar Scripts\n\nDevanagari vs. Gujarati: Look for the continuous top bar.\nTamil vs. Malayalam: Tamil letters are more open; Malayalam is dense and rounded with vertical stacking.\nTelugu vs. Kannada: Compare loop size and shape; Telugu larger, more circular.\nBengali vs. Odia: Odia is more circular; Bengali is more angular at loop ends.\nGurmukhi vs. Devanagari: Gurmukhi’s broken headstroke and uniform height contrast Devanagari’s flowing shirorekha.\n\n\n7. GeoGuessr‑Specific Strategies\n\nMeta‑clues: Combine script ID with car metas (e.g., Kerala often Gen2 Google car), license‑plate colors, road‑paint style, and driving side.\nEnvironmental cues: Architectural style, landscape, vegetation often align with script regions.\nCamera artifacts: Blurring or plate coverage differs by state and country—note alongside scripts.\n\n\n8.

While I strive for accuracy, content here reflects my own ongoing learning process. Use it as a helpful guide, but always verify details where precision matters.\n🗂️ Organization\nI’ve organized pages into two main categories:\n\n\nMetas offer an additive, bottom-up way to derive a location guess — e.g., short license plates + double yellow road markings + speed limit in MPH = United States. This kind of information is especially useful for general region-guessing and in no move/NMPZ modes, where you typically have less to go on. Some key metas include:\n\nRoadside bollards\nFlags\nLanguages\nLicense plates\nDomains\n\n\n\nPlace entries take a more subtractive, top-down approach. A broad base of knowledge about specific locations gives you “bundles” of clues you can unpack to eliminate possibilities and hone in on a likely guess — e.g., Turkey has “Dur” on stop signs, distinctive gray dumpsters, and the Turkish language features many “Ş” characters. The more of these clues you spot, the more confident you can be.\n\nPlace entries are organized hierarchically, from broad to narrow, with continents at the top level.\nWithin each top-level continent folder, there are subfolders for individual countries and for international regions — these might be groups of countries with shared cultural, linguistic, or historical ties, or they might represent non-border-aligned regions like climatic zones.\nWithin each country folder, you’ll find subfolders for individual cities, subdivisions (a catch-all for states, provinces, prefectures, etc.), and intra-national regions. These might be clusters of subdivisions with distinct traits or borderless areas defined by similar climate, geography, or cultural patterns, all contained within one country.\n\n\n\n🤝 Contributions\nWhile this is primarily a personal knowledge base, I’m always open to thoughtful feedback, corrections, or ideas to improve it. If you’ve noticed an error, have a great meta clue to share, or just want to chat about GeoGuessr I’d love to hear from you!\n💡 How to Contribute\n\n📝 Suggestions: Have a correction, idea, or fun bollard style name to suggest?
