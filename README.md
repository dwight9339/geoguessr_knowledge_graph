# **🌐 Welcome!**

This is my personal knowledge base of the world as it relates to **GeoGuessr**! 

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is a **personal learning tool**, not an encyclopedia. While I strive for accuracy, content here reflects my own ongoing learning process. Use it as a helpful guide, but always verify details where precision matters.

## **🗂️ Organization**

I've organized pages into **two main categories**:

- **Metas** offer an additive, bottom-up way to derive a location guess — e.g., short license plates + double yellow road markings + speed limit in MPH = United States. This kind of information is especially useful for general region-guessing and in no move/NMPZ modes, where you typically have less to go on. Some key metas include:
    - Roadside bollards
    - Flags
    - Languages
    - License plates
    - Domains

- **Place** entries take a more subtractive, top-down approach. A broad base of knowledge about specific locations gives you “bundles” of clues you can unpack to eliminate possibilities and hone in on a likely guess — e.g., Turkey has “Dur” on stop signs, distinctive gray dumpsters, and the Turkish language features many "Ş" characters. The more of these clues you spot, the more confident you can be.

    - Place entries are organized hierarchically, from broad to narrow, with continents at the top level.
    - Within each top-level continent folder, there are subfolders for individual countries and for international regions — these might be groups of countries with shared cultural, linguistic, or historical ties, or they might represent non-border-aligned regions like climatic zones.
    - Within each country folder, you’ll find subfolders for individual cities, subdivisions (a catch-all for states, provinces, prefectures, etc.), and intra-national regions. These might be clusters of subdivisions with distinct traits or borderless areas defined by similar climate, geography, or cultural patterns, all contained within a single country.

## 🤝 Contributions

While this is primarily a personal knowledge base, I'm always open to thoughtful feedback, corrections, or ideas to improve it. If you’ve noticed an error, have a great meta clue to share, or just want to chat about GeoGuessr I’d love to hear from you!
