# **🌐 Welcome!**

This is my personal knowledge base of the world as it relates to **GeoGuessr**.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is a **personal learning tool**, not an encyclopedia. While I strive for accuracy, content here reflects my own ongoing learning process. Use it as a helpful guide, but always verify details where precision matters.

## **🗂️ Organization**

I've organized pages into **two main categories**:

- **[[📌Metas|Metas]]** offer an additive, bottom-up way to derive a location guess — e.g., short license plates + double yellow road markings + "Speed Limit" sign = [[United States]]. This kind of information is especially useful for general region-guessing and in no move/NMPZ modes, where you typically have less to go on. Some key metas include:
    - [[📌Bollards|Roadside bollards]]
    - [[📌Flags|Flags]]
    - [[📌Languages|Languages]]
    - [[📌License Plates|License plates]]
    - [[Domains]]

- **[[📌Places|Place]]** entries take a more subtractive, top-down approach. A broad base of knowledge about specific locations gives you “bundles” of clues you can unpack to eliminate possibilities and hone in on a likely guess — e.g., [[Turkey]] has “Dur” on stop signs, distinctive gray dumpsters, and the Turkish language is keen on the "Ş" character. The more of these clues you spot, the more confident you can be.

    - Place entries are organized hierarchically, from broad to narrow, with continents at the top level.
    - Within each top-level continent folder, there are subfolders for individual countries and for international regions — these might be groups of countries with shared cultural, linguistic, or historical ties, or they might represent non-border-aligned regions like climatic zones.
    - Within each country folder, you’ll find subfolders for individual cities, subdivisions (a catch-all for states, provinces, prefectures, etc.), and intra-national regions. These might be clusters of subdivisions with distinct traits or borderless areas defined by similar climate, geography, or cultural patterns, all contained within a single country.

## 🤝 Contributions

While this is primarily a personal knowledge base, I'm always open to thoughtful feedback, corrections, or ideas to improve it. If you’ve noticed an error, have a great meta clue to share, or just want to chat about GeoGuessr I’d love to hear from you!
