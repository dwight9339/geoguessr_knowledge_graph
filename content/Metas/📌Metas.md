## **Overview**

**Metas** are categories of things available in the Google Street View imagery used by GeoGuessr that can be used to arrive at a guess about where in this wide world you were dropped at the start of the round. While it's debatable whether metas like the [[ðŸ“Œ Camera Generation|generation or type]] of camera or the [[ðŸ“ŒGoogle Cars|specific cars]] used to capture Street View images is in the true "spirit" of the game since they don't really relate directly to geographical knowledge, _anything_ that can be seen and recognized in these images can potentially provide information that a player with the right knowledge might use to their advantage. The top-level (ðŸ“Œ) page for each meta contains a description and various information about the meta (the meta meta, if you will) to help you decide how best, or even whether at all, to learn and employ it.

## **Why Learn Metas?**

I like to think of metas as providing sets of **likelihood vectors**. When you recognize a specific **meta clue** it tells you information about where and, as importantly, where *not* you're likely to be. By stacking these vectors, certain locations gradually rise in likelihood, allowing you to narrow your set of **location candidates**. The more vectors you combine (i.e., the more meta clues you recognize), the narrower and more definitive your candidate set becomes.
