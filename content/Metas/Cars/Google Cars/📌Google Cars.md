# Google Car Meta

The ability to identify the specific cars used to capture Google Street View imagery can provide an arguably unfair advantage in the game that is mitigated only by the sheer number of individual vehicles to memorize, the fact that cars are often obscured, and the fact that Google updates Street View imagery frequently, negating previously memorized meta.
